=head1 NAME

perltidy_ko - tidy perl files in Komodo with a project rc

=head1 VERSION

version 1.120910

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Define this script as a formatter in your Komodo preferences. Perl::Tidy
will then use either .perltidyrc in the same directory as the currently
open file, or if that does not exist, walk up the directories until it
finds a .perltidyrc in a directory that also contains a lib directory and
use that, or if that does not exist defer to Perl::Tidy's inbuilt search
algorithms.
